TODO training part steps:
	1-fix mdoels refrences in train scripts
	2-take all edited scripts form google drive


I have two options:
	
	get training code that one on the drive 

	begin with right_labeling.py and merge it with pipeline.py 
	


	
how is training working?
	1-(input: sql--labels-- and videos) run right_labeling.py (output: labeled rgb videos)
	2-(input: labled videos) run pipeline_i3d.py (output: labeled rgbFrames,OflowFrames )
